Solution Breif:

Revolutionize cancer surgery with our real-time computer vision system for intraoperative margin assessment. 
Our solution, leveraging state-of-the-art deep learning models like U-Net for semantic segmentation and 
Faster R-CNN for object detection, ensures precise identification of tumor margins during surgery. Integrated
with surgical instruments and employing augmented reality, it delivers instantaneous feedback to surgeons, 
minimizing the risk of cancer recurrence. This groundbreaking technology combines efficiency, accuracy, 
and user-friendliness, promising improved surgical outcomes and reduced reoperation rates. Through continuous 
refinement and collaboration with healthcare professionals, our system sets a new standard in intraoperative 
margin assessment, advancing the forefront of cancer care.
